This is the README for the DataMining application of our Movie Database. 

There are some options that we could try:

- We have the variable box office gross
    - we can see which factors might affect this:
        - budget
        - genre
        - release date
        - etc...

This datamining.ipynb goes through each of these and determines their relationship. Some of these are numerical values, while some are categorical.

For each, we can still find and determine the correlation between the dependent and independent variables.

At the end, we manually validate that the top 10 grossing movies match many of these factors.
